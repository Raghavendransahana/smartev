# Open Charge Map API Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

The EV Stations page works immediately with **demo data** - no setup required! However, for real-time charging station data, you'll need a free OCM API key.

## Demo Mode vs Real Data

### Demo Mode (Default)
- **Works immediately** with sample charging stations
- Shows 3 demo stations in major Indian cities
- Blue info message explaining how to get real data
- Perfect for development and testing

### Real Data Mode
- **Requires free API key** from Open Charge Map
- Access to 500,000+ real charging stations worldwide
- Real-time availability and station details
- Updated by community contributors
